## 🧠 Credits

Bootcamp supervisor : [Er. Santa Basnet](https://github.com/santabasnet)

The effort that has been done by respected supervisor for preparing the entire infrastructure of bootcamp and problems has not only helped me learn the solutions to the problem but rather understand the implication of concepts such as map, vectors and other tools. This has gave me boost in capacity to understand the fundamentals of C and NLP. I have understood the basic building block of NLP that is set theory and vector theory.

I would like to heavily recommend this bootcamp to any one who wants to learn C/C++ or other languages + learn about the implications of NLP and its basics.
